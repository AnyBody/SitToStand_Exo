# SitToStand_Exo

This is the model example from the [old exeskeleton webcast with AnyBody](https://www.anybodytech.com/resources/documentation/#c708). It is also identical with the model on the AnyScript Wiki page. 

**New:** this version of the example has been updated to work with the newest version of the AnyBody and the newest Model repository. It also uses the TLEM 2.0 leg model.

However, the results of the model has not been validated yet. It is only provided to help users who were strugling to make the old example run with the newest version of AnyBody.

> Note: this is still a very simplified example of howto connect a exoskeleton in AnyBody.
